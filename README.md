## Doodles in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Some course work for edX's [IBM PY0101EN Python Basics for Data Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:IBM+PY0101EN+1T2019/course/) or Coursera's [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow)

...and/or some Python doodles may be found in this repository.


#### Notes for *Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning*

Check if you have Tensorflow installed (I use Python 3 so I'm using ```pip3```)

    pip3 show tensorflow

If you don't have it already, install it

    pip3 install tensorflow

[Start](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html#notebook-user-interface) your first Jupyter notebook (courtesy Coursera Introduction to AI course)

    cd intro_T4AI_ML_DL
    jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb

or run the first exercise (house price estimation):

    jupyter notebook Exercise_1_House_Prices_Question.ipynb

In case you have converted the Jupyter notebook into regular Python code (which is easily done with the Visual Studio Code [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) for instance) you can execute it from the terminal as well:

    python3 Exercise_1_House_Prices_Question.py
